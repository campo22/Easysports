feat: Enhance team functionalities and UI localization

This commit introduces backend and frontend enhancements to support formal matches with team selection, and localizes the UI to Spanish.

**Backend:**
- Added a new endpoint `GET /v1/teams` to retrieve all teams.
- Implemented the corresponding service layer to fetch all teams from the database.

**Frontend:**
- **Create Match Screen**: Now fetches and displays the user's teams and all other teams for selection in formal matches. The UI has been translated to Spanish.
- **Home Dashboard**:
    - The main floating action button now creates a team instead of a match.
    - The UI has been localized to Spanish.
    - Match cards have been redesigned for better readability and information display.
    - The "Top Leaders" section has been visually improved.
- **Localization**: The bottom navigation bar and login screen are now in Spanish.
- **API Service**: A new `getAllTeams()` method has been added to the API service.
- **UI Components**: The `SportCard` widget has been updated with a new visual style.
